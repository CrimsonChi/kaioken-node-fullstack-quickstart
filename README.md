## _Drizzle_

First, ensure that `DATABASE_URL` is configured in `.env` file, then create the database:

```bash
pnpm drizzle:generate # a script that executes drizzle-kit generate.
pnpm drizzle:migrate # a script that executes drizzle-kit migrate.
```

> \[!NOTE]
> The `drizzle-kit generate` command is used to generate SQL migration files based on your Drizzle schema.
>
> The `drizzle-kit migrate` command is used to apply the generated migrations to your database.

## _Better Auth_

Better Auth is a library for authentication and authorization. It's already wired up with the app, so you can use it out of the box - just set up the `AUTH_SECRET` & `BASE_URL` environment variables.

GitHub OAuth is also set up out of the box - just create a GitHub app and set up the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

## _Kaioken+Vike_

This app is ready to start. It's powered by [Vike](https://vike.dev) and [Kaioken](https://kaioken.dev).

### `/pages/+config.ts`

Such `+` files are [the interface](https://vike.dev/config) between Vike and your code. It defines:

- A default [`<Layout>` component](https://vike.dev/Layout) (that wraps your [`<Page>` components](https://vike.dev/Page)).
- A default [`title`](https://vike.dev/title).
- Global [`<head>` tags](https://vike.dev/head-tags).

### Routing

[Vike's built-in router](https://vike.dev/routing) lets you choose between:

- [Filesystem Routing](https://vike.dev/filesystem-routing) (the URL of a page is determined based on where its `+Page.jsx` file is located on the filesystem)
- [Route Strings](https://vike.dev/route-string)
- [Route Functions](https://vike.dev/route-function)

### `/pages/_error/+Page.jsx`

The [error page](https://vike.dev/error-page) which is rendered when errors occur.

### SSR

SSR is enabled by default. You can [disable it](https://vike.dev/ssr) for all your pages or only for some pages.

### HTML Streaming

You can enable/disable [HTML streaming](https://vike.dev/stream) for all your pages, or only for some pages while still using it for others.
